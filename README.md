# Russian-English-humor-corpus
## Hi!
#### For my bachelor's work, I created two parallel corpus of humorous texts. Russian jokes were translated into English, and English jokes were translated into Russian.
---
##### org-ang, angl.txt - a corpus of English jokes and anecdotes, partly taken from the Reddit dataset, partly-jokes and stories from the Internet. The corpus is translated into Russian, the translation is in the file-org-ang,rus.txt. 
---
##### org-rus,rus.txt -a corpus of Russian jokes and anecdotes, partly taken from the jokes dataset from the Internet, partly collected by me. The corpus is translated into English, the translation is in the org-rus file,angl.txt.

## I hope these corpora will help linguists develop automatic translation of humor and improve its quality!
